This is simply a small iOS app that plays around with customizing colleciton view layouts and Core Image Filter. I wanted to add in the ability to add frames to photos using `PhotoEditorSDK` but I want to focus on other projects. I will upload the png files for the frames and if anyone would like to contribute, they are more than welcome to!
